# YouTube Code

Welcome to **ProcessOverProfit** - code examples and resources from our YouTube channel for building automated trading systems.

## What is Trading Automation?

Trading automation allows you to execute trading strategies automatically using algorithms and bots. Instead of manually monitoring markets and placing trades, automated systems can:

- **Execute trades 24/7** - Never miss an opportunity, even while you sleep
- **Remove emotion** - Make decisions based on data and logic, not fear or greed
- **Backtest strategies** - Test your ideas on historical data before risking real capital
- **Scale efficiently** - Run multiple strategies across different markets simultaneously

## Getting Started

To begin automating your trading, you'll need:

1. **A trading account** with a broker that supports API access
2. **Programming knowledge** (Python is recommended for most platforms)
3. **A clear trading strategy** to automate
4. **Risk management rules** to protect your capital

## Core Principles

### Process Over Profit

The name says it all - focus on building robust, repeatable processes rather than chasing quick profits. A well-designed automated trading system should:

- Follow a clear, documented strategy
- Have built-in risk management
- Be tested thoroughly before live deployment
- Be monitored and optimized continuously

### Key Components

Every automated trading system needs:

- **Strategy Logic** - The rules that determine when to buy and sell
- **Risk Management** - Position sizing, stop losses, and maximum drawdown limits
- **Execution Engine** - The code that connects to your broker and places orders
- **Monitoring System** - Tools to track performance and detect issues
