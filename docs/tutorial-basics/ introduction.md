# Getting Started

Welcome to the NightShark knowledge base. This tutorial track focuses on the scripting fundamentals you need to automate trades quickly and safely.

## What You’ll Learn

- How NightShark represents on-screen data through points and areas  
- The core functions—`read_areas()`, `Click()`, and `toNumber()`—that power every strategy  
- Techniques for structuring reusable logic with variables, loops, and custom functions

## How the Tutorials Are Organized

1. **Foundations** — Meet the built-in helpers and learn how to map your trading platform.  
2. **State Management** — Capture data with variables and convert raw text into numbers.  
3. **Decision Logic** — Combine conditional checks with loops to automate reactions.  
4. **Action Routines** — Orchestrate clicks and orders without manual intervention.

Each article includes actionable snippets you can paste directly into a NightShark script.

## Prerequisites

- NightShark desktop app installed and linked to a test account  
- Familiarity with basic trading concepts (entries, exits, stop losses)  
- A simulator or paper trading environment for experimentation

:::tip Prefer hands-on practice?
